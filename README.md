# Important Notes:
* If, for any reason, the setup program doesn't add the application to the startup registry (regedit), you can manually run "add_to_startup.bat" located in the installation folder by double-clicking it.
* This program is set to run automatically at PC startup by default. If you disable it, automatic backups will no longer occur.
